# My Personal Project

## Woman Shelter Application


An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  

The application will help people in the shelter access neecessities like clothes, hygiene products, local gift cards (for gas, groceries, phone, transit vouchers), and monetary donations for food and medications.

The application will have a login window to ask if the user is a person in need or a sponsor. If it is the person in need, she will be able to access available items or put in a request about her needs. The sponsor will only see requests, and fulfill them, or if there are no requests, the sponsor's donation will update the list of available items.

I wanted to implement this project as I noticed that most of the time we have clothes we don't wear anymore, furniture we don't need or want to help with sometimes but don't know how or what exactly is needed. This application will assist in both getting help and getting the knowledge about how to help.

**User Stories:**

-As a user, I want to be able to identify myself as a person in need or a sponsor.

-As a person in need, I want to be able to add a request to the list.

-As a person in need, I want to be able to view the list of available items.

-As a sponsor, I want to be able to donate.

-As a person in need, I want to be able to save requests I made for sponsors to be seen

-As a person in need, I want to be able to save the changes I made after taking donations

-As a person in need, I want to be able to see updated list of donations every time I open application

-As a sponsor, I want to be able to see new requests

-As a sponsor, I want my donation to be saved 

As a sponsor, I want my donations to be seen by person in need

**Persistence package is Based on the supplied Workroom example for CPSC 210.**

# Instruction for grader

- You can generate the first required event related to adding Xs to a Y by opening application, login in as a user
and making donations(any will work)
- You can generate the second required event related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking the list of available items
and noticing the item in the list or donation being increased by the number you input
- You can locate my visual component by opening the application and seeing it on the login page
- You can save the state of my application by clicking the save button
- You can reload the state of my application by clicking the load button

# Phase 4: Task 2
- New monetary donation to shelter
- New item of furniture added to shelter.
- New item of clothing added to shelter.
- Piece of clothing was taken from the shelter.
- Furniture was taken from the shelter.
- User took some monetary donations from shelter

# Phase 4: Task 3
 If I had more time, the most important thing I would do is to either merge
shelter app with shelter gui or delete shelter app at all. Both classes have the same application, the only difference,
 is that Gui is more visual.

Also even though it is not seen in the UML diagram, I would refactor my ShelterGui class.As I have to different pages for user and sponsor, 
A lot of the code is repetitive with difference in one or two lines, which I didn't have time to understand.

Moreover, A lot of the methods there have very repetitive function that would be nice to change
