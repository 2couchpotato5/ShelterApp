## Woman Shelter Application


An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  

The application will help people in the shelter access necessities like clothes, hygiene products, local gift cards (for gas, groceries, phone, transit vouchers), and monetary donations for food and medications.

The application will have a login window to ask if the user is a person in need or a sponsor. If it is the person in need, she will be able to access available items or put in a request about her needs. The sponsor will only see requests, and fulfill them, or if there are no requests, the sponsor's donation will update the list of available items.

I wanted to implement this project as I noticed that most of the time we have clothes we don't wear anymore, furniture we don't need or want to help with sometimes but don't know how or what exactly is needed. This application will assist in both getting help and getting the knowledge about how to help.
